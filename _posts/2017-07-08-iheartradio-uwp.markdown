Official iHeart Radio app for windows platform. iHeartRadio is an Internet radio platform owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. This universal windows application supports windows 10, windows 10 mobile and Xbox One platforms using single code base. As the UX lead my responsibility was to handle complicated UX and UI design from client. Developed on top of the latest UWP stack with all rich UWP features like connected animations built in.
