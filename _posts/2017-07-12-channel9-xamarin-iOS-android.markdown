The official Channel 9 app on iOs and android. Channel 9 is a Microsoft community site for Microsoft customers created in 2004. It hosts video channels, discussions, podcasts, screen casts and interviews. Built with Xamarin, this is a cross platform application that works on both iOS and android. I was the UX lead for this app, responsible for the entire UI for iOs and Android versions
