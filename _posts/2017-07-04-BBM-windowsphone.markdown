Official BlackBerry Messenger for Windows Phone. I was part of the team that released the first three versions of BBM on windows store. Initial release supports functionalities like location, image, audio, files and chat sharing. Version 2 supports timed message, retract message and stickers and finally Version 3 with channels. I was responsible for the entire User Experience, Design Integration of the app.
